# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dynamic Route Configuration
**Problem**: Dynamic routes `/forms/[program]-intake` and `/schedule/[program]` were not properly configured for static generation.

**Solution**: 
- Added `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` to both dynamic route pages
- Renamed `/forms/[program]-intake.tsx` to `/forms/[program].tsx` (Next.js requires clean parameter names in brackets)
- Updated the component to handle the `-intake` suffix validation in `getStaticProps`

### 2. Route Consistency
**Problem**: Health & Well-Being program had inconsistent URLs (`/forms/health-intake` vs program key `health-wellbeing`)

**Solution**:
- Updated health-wellbeing.tsx to use consistent URLs:
  - `/forms/health-wellbeing-intake`
  - `/schedule/health-wellbeing`

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Route Files Updated:
1. **`/pages/forms/[program].tsx`**
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Implemented `getStaticPaths` to pre-render paths for all programs
   - Added `getStaticProps` with validation for `-intake` suffix
   - Added fallback loading state using `router.isFallback`
   - Set ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) with 60-second revalidation

2. **`/pages/schedule/[program].tsx`**
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Implemented `getStaticPaths` for all program scheduling pages
   - Added `getStaticProps` with program validation
   - Added fallback loading state
   - Set ISR with 60-second revalidation

### Build Results
- All pages now successfully pre-render at build time
- Dynamic routes use ISR for updates
- Build outputs show correct paths with i18n prefix (`/en/`)
- No TypeScript or build errors

## Verification
Run `npm run build` to verify all pages build successfully. The output should show:
- ‚óè (SSG) markers for dynamic routes
- (ISR: 60 Seconds) indicating incremental regeneration
- All program paths pre-rendered

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel or any other hosting platform that supports Next.js static generation.
