### Option 1: Check Deployment Status (Recommended)

2. Find the "ruralcap-redesign" project
3. Click "Visit" to see the live site
4. Or click "Redeploy" if needed

### Option 3: Import from GitHub (Clean Deploy)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import: https://github.com/anna9891/ruralcap-website-redesign
3. Deploy fresh

## Expected Deployment URL

Once deployed successfully, your site will be available at:
```
https://ruralcap-redesign.vercel.app
```

Or with a unique subdomain like:
```
https://ruralcap-redesign-[unique-id].vercel.app
```

## Update Your Proposal

Once you have the final URL:
```bash
./update-proposal-url.sh
```

Enter your Vercel URL when prompted to update the proposal.

## Troubleshooting

If deployments are stuck:
1. Cancel queued deployments in Vercel dashboard
