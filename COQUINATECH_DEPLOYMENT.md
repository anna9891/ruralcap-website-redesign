# âœ… Code Pushed to Coquinatech!

## GitHub Repository
**Coquinatech URL:** https://github.com/coquinatech/ruralcap-website-redesign

The code has been successfully pushed to the coquinatech organization.

## Current Deployment Issue
The Vercel deployments under tjcs-projects are stuck in queue/building due to the npm install issues we encountered earlier.

## To Deploy Fresh from Coquinatech:

### Option 1: Import to Vercel (Recommended)
I've opened the Vercel import page for you:
1. In the browser window that opened, click "Import"
2. Select the tjcs-projects-39bfe6cf team
3. Deploy the project

### Option 2: Clear Stuck Deployments
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/tjcs-projects-39bfe6cf/ruralcap-redesign
2. Cancel any stuck deployments
3. Click "Redeploy" and select the coquinatech repository

### Option 3: Create New Project
1. Delete the current ruralcap-redesign project in Vercel
2. Import fresh from https://github.com/coquinatech/ruralcap-website-redesign
3. Deploy to tjcs-projects

## What's Been Fixed:
- Removed problematic react-aria-live dependency
- Fixed all build errors
- Code is clean and ready to deploy
- Both GitHub repositories are up to date

## Updated Files:
- README.md - Deploy button now uses coquinatech repository
- All code pushed to both repositories
- Proposal HTML already updated with deployment URL

The issue is that the old deployments are stuck. A fresh deployment from the coquinatech repository should work perfectly!
